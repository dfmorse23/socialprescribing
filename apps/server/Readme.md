# Auth Api Calls

## Auth Setup

We are using POSTGRESQL as our database. So, you need to have a postgresql server running on your machine. You can install it from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or try installing it using brew on mac:
    
```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```
- Create a new database using the command: 
```bash
createdb [name]
```
- Make sure that DATABASE_URL is in the ROOT PROJECT .env file
```bash
 postgres://YourUserName:YourPassword@localHost:5432/YourDatabaseName
```
- Ensure you have proper env variables set. (Refer to .env.sample)
- Install all dependencies and deploy schema to database using the command: 
```bash
yarn initialize
```

## Migrations
if you want to make changes to the schema, you can use the following commands to migrate the database:

### Development
```bash
yarn prisma migrate dev --name init
yarn primsa generate
```

or 

### Production
```bash
yarn prisma migrate deploy
```
